<h3 style ="color: coral">SLEEP</h3>
<h4><u><b>Explanation</b></u></h4>
<p>Lack of sleep has been associated with many chronic conditions like type-2 diabetes, depression, and more issues in the health of many adults. The average adult needs 7 hours of sleep each night for the best daily well being. By ensuring that you get an adequate amount of sleep each night, you can help give your body the rest it needs to recover and produce important infection fighting cells and antibodies.</p>
<h4><u><b>How to get better sleep</b></u></h4>
<p>Getting a sufficient amount of sleep can be hard for anyone, especially those with demanding work schedules...we see you college students, but it’s important to get enough sleep for physical and mental health, so here’s some ways to help:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stick to a schedule. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. </li>
    <li>Keep your electronics out of our bedroom. This helps reduce the temptation to scroll through that tik tok for you page for a couple minutes, that inevitably turns into a couple hours, right before bed.</li>
    <li>Try to avoid drinking caffeine in the afternoon/evenings.<li>
    <li>Getting some exercise during the day can help you fall asleep faster at night.</li>
</ul>
